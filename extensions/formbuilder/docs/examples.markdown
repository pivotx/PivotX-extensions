# Examples

## Use quicktags in entries or pages

See the options for `[[ contactform ]]` [example](example_contactform.markdown) and `[[ orderform ]]` [example](example_orderform.markdown) tags in entries and pages.

## Use in a PivotX template

You can use the quicktags in any template, you can also use the advanced method in a template.


### Advanced method (PHP knowledge required)

Download or view the [example template](example_template.html) with a text or code editor and start from there.

The formbuilder in a template is more flexible than the quick tags. Create a template with the form configuration in a `[[ php ]]` block, or copy the example template and start from there.

You have to set the `allow_php_in_templates` to 1 in the advanced configuration of your PivotX installation if you want to use this.

Most options are described in [Advanced options](advanced_options.markdown).

You can also look in the `_formbuilder_contactform.php` file for examples.
