Sociable Bookmarking
====================

This extension adds links to various social bookmarking sites. After enabling
this extension, you can configure it in the administration screen at Extensions
&raquo;  Configure Extensions &raquo; Sociable.

Make sure you add the `[[sociable]]` tag to your template(s). It can be placed
in a weblogtemplate, somewhere between `[[weblog]]` and `[[/weblog]]`. To add
links from on individual entry pages, you can place it anywhere in the
entrypage template.

It is based loosely on the [Sociable extension][1] for Wordpress, by
Peter Harkins, Joost de valk.
