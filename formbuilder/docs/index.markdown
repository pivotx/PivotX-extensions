# Formbuilder for Pivotx

## What is it

The formclass is a 'form to mail' script that you can use for multiple forms on your website. You can also use it as a template based formbuilder.

The script uses the Swiftmailer library ( [http://swiftmailer.org/](http://swiftmailer.org/) ) and a modified version of the formlibrary that is included in PivotX ( [http://www.pivotx.net/](http://www.pivotx.net/) )

## Security Warning!

Using the send to friend (`[[sendtofriend]]`) form will open up your site to a kind of anonymous spam relay where anyone can use your website to __send messages to anyone__ else.

There is a small protection built in, but this will only protect against the simpelest spambots, and has already been bypassed.

## Requirements

You need a webserver with PHP (Version 5.x) and access to the mail function or a SMTP account and PivotX

For including and styling the form you need a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS. For advanced configuration you need PHP knowledge.
