Sociable Bookmarking
====================

This extension adds links to various social bookmarking sites. After enabling
this extension, you can configure it in the administration screen at Extensions
&raquo;  Configure Extensions &raquo; Sociable.

Make sure you add the `[[ sociable ]]` tag to your template(s). It can be placed
in a weblogtemplate, somewhere between `[[ weblog ]]` and `[[ /weblog ]]`. To add
links in individual entries or pages, you can place it anywhere in the
entry or page template.

It is based loosely on the [Sociable extension][1] for Wordpress, by
Peter Harkins, Joost de Valk.
